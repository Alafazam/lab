# Solar system powered by CSS3 animations

Experimenting with CSS3 animations and 2D transitions to illustrate the power of modern CSS as a layer onto some simple HTML. Representing the solar system correctly is impossible, ofcourse, but the idea worked out OK-ish.

This experiment is built in Chrome 22 and hasn't be tested in other browsers. The demo should work in a modern WebKit-based browsers, but no guarantees!
