# Google Codejam Javascript arena

A simple JS arena to ease solving the always awesome Google Codejam assignments.

## Usage
1. Fork / download the code, open codejam.htm in a browser of your choice.
2. Enter the assignments input data into the left textarea ("In").
3. Solve the assignment (this is the hard part) (there's a solve-method in codejam.js waiting to be used).
4. Press the "Run code" button; the result is printed to the right textarea in the proper format.
5. Copy the result into output-l.txt or output-s.txt, ZIP all the files into a single file and submit your answer.

There isn't much more you need to solve the assignments with JS in a browser environment. The arena could be improved with some more sugar, like reading the input from an input file and directly writing the output to an output file. Feel free to fork and improve :)
